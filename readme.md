## Introduction
Frogger is a popular arcade game developed by Konami in 1981. This project aims to replicate Frogger's gameplay using Python and Turtle graphics. The game revolves around a frog that the player guides across a busy road and a river full of logs to get to safety.

## Features
* Navigation through the game world using keyboard controls (Up, Down, Right, Left keys).
* Dynamic obstacles in the form of cars and logs.
* Gradually increasing difficulty by increasing game speed after each level.
* Options to freeze and unfreeze logs for a dynamic gaming experience.
* Option to replay the game after game over or after beating the game.
